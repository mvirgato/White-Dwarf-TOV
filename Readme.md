# White Dwarf internal structure

This code generates equations of state based off the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller (FMT) model for various atomic species.
These can then be used to solve the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations to obtain radial profiles for various thermodynamic quantities (number density, pressure, electron chemical potential, ...)

The majority of this code was written during the early stages of my PhD, useing this project as an oppotunity to learn Python from scratch. This leaves the code somewhat disorganised.

This code is written by a physicist, for the purposes of producing accurate data to be used in further research. The goal was not for this code to be examied or used by other people.
