# White Dwarf internal structure

This code has been used in several published papers:

* [Improved Treatment of Dark Matter Capture in White Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14367)
* [Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16272)

This code generates state equations based on the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller (FMT) model for various atomic species.
These can then be used to solve the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations to obtain radial profiles for various thermodynamic quantities (number density, pressure, electron chemical potential, ...)

The majority of this code was written during the early stages of my PhD, using this project as an opportunity to learn Python from scratch. This leaves the code somewhat disorganised.

This code is written by a physicist, for the purposes of producing accurate data to be used in further research. The goal was not for this code to be examied or used by other people.
